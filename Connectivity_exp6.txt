To create a MySQL database and table for this Python program, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open MySQL Command Line or Workbench
Command Line: Type mysql -u root -p and enter your MySQL root password.
MySQL Workbench: Open Workbench, log in, and use the query editor.
Step 2: Create a Database
Run the following SQL command to create a new database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
Replace your_database_name with the name you'd like to give to your database.

Step 3: Use the Database
Switch to the new database to start creating tables within it:

sql
Copy code
USE your_database_name;
Step 4: Create a Table
Now, create a table named students with id and name columns:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
id: An integer column that acts as the primary key.
name: A string (VARCHAR) column for storing the student's name.
Example of Complete SQL Code
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE school;
USE school;

CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
Step 5: Verify the Table
You can verify that the table was created by running:

sql
Copy code
SHOW TABLES;
To see the structure of the students table, run:

sql
Copy code
DESCRIBE students;
Step 6: Insert Test Data (Optional)
You can add some initial data to test the database:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO students (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe'), (2, 'Jane Doe');

In your MySQL command mysql -u your_existing_user -p, the placeholder your_existing_user should be replaced with the actual username of the user you want to connect to the MySQL server.

If you're unsure of what usernames exist in your MySQL server, you can list them by running the following query while logged in as a user with sufficient privileges (like the root user):

sql
Copy code
SELECT User FROM mysql.user;
This command will return a list of all usernames in your MySQL server. You can then use any of those usernames to connect, for example:

bash
Copy code
mysql -u <actual_username> -p

def connect():
    try:
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host='localhost',
            database='your_database_name',  # Replace with your database name
            user='root',           # Replace with your MySQL username
            password='1234@5678m'        # Replace with your MySQL password
        )
        if connection.is_connected():
            print("Connected to MySQL database")
            return connection
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

def add_data(connection, id, name):
    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO students (id, name) VALUES (%s, %s)", (id, name))
        connection.commit()
        print("Data added successfully.")
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

def delete_data(connection, id):
    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("DELETE FROM students WHERE id = %s", (id,))
        connection.commit()
        print("Data deleted successfully.")

def edit_data(connection, id, new_name):
    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("UPDATE students SET name = %s WHERE id = %s", (new_name, id))
        connection.commit()
        print("Data updated successfully.")
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

def retrieve_data(connection):
    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students")
        records = cursor.fetchall()
        for row in records:
            print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}")
    except Error as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

def main():
    connection = connect()
    if connection:
        # Perform database operations
        add_data(connection, 1, "John Doe")

To run your MySQL Python script on Ubuntu, you need to ensure that you have Python, MySQL, and the mysql-connector-python library installed. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. Install MySQL Server
If you haven't installed MySQL on your Ubuntu system, you can do so by running the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
2. Secure MySQL Installation
After installation, it's a good idea to run the MySQL security script:

bash
Copy code
sudo mysql_secure_installation
This script will prompt you to set a root password and configure other security settings.

3. Install Python and pip
Ensure that you have Python and pip (Python package manager) installed:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
4. Install MySQL Connector for Python
You need to install the mysql-connector-python package to allow Python to interact with MySQL:

bash
Copy code
pip3 install mysql-connector-python
5. Create Your Python Script
Open a text editor (like nano, vim, or any other code editor).
Paste your Python script into the editor.
Save the file with a .py extension, e.g., mysql_script.py.
For example, using nano:

bash
Copy code
nano mysql_script.py
6. Modify the Script
Make sure to replace the following placeholders in your script:

your_database_name with the actual name of your database.
Use user='root' for the MySQL username.
Use your actual password for the MySQL root user.
7. Run Your Python Script
Navigate to the directory where your script is saved, and then run:

bash
Copy code
python3 mysql_script.py
Example Commands
Here’s a complete example of commands you might run in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install MySQL server
sudo apt install mysql-server

# Secure MySQL installation
sudo mysql_secure_installation

# Install Python and pip
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Install MySQL connector for Python
pip3 install mysql-connector-python

# Create and edit your Python script
nano mysql_script.py

# (Paste your script and save it)

# Run your script
python3 mysql_script.py
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues connecting to MySQL, make sure your MySQL server is running. You can start it with:
bash
Copy code
sudo service mysql start
Ensure that the MySQL service is listening on the correct port (default is 3306) and that you have the correct permissions for the user you are trying to connect with.
Following these steps should help you run your MySQL Python script on Ubuntu successfully! If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
